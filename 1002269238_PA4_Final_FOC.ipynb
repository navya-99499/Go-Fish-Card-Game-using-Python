The program should simulate a game between two players, where each player draws cards from a central deck to collect sets of matching cards. The game ends when the deck is empty, and the player with the most sets at the end of the game wins. The program should use QUEUE to represent each player's hand and a STACK to represent the central deck of cards. The game should be playable in the command-line interface, with the option to specify the number of players and the number of cards dealt to each player at the start of the game.\""],"metadata":{"id":"7bt5YSaL3V9M"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import random\n","from collections import deque\n","\n","\n","# Stack class to represent the deck of cards\n","class Stack:\n","    def __init__(self):\n","        self.stack = []\n","\n","    def push(self, item):\n","        self.stack.append(item)  # Add a card to the stack (deck)\n","\n","    def pop(self):\n","        return self.stack.pop() if not self.is_empty() else None  # Remove and return top card if stack isn't empty\n","\n","    def is_empty(self):\n","        return len(self.stack) == 0  # Check if the deck is empty\n","\n","    def size(self):\n","        return len(self.stack)  # Return number of cards in the deck\n","\n","\n","# Player class to represent each player's state and behavior\n","class Player:\n","    def __init__(self, name):\n","        self.name = name\n","        self.hand = deque()   # Cards in hand\n","        self.books = []       # Completed books (4 of the same rank)\n","\n","    def draw_card(self, deck):\n","        if not deck.is_empty():  # Draw a card from the deck if it's not empty\n","            card = deck.pop().upper()\n","            self.hand.append(card)\n","            print(f\"{self.name} drew a card.\")\n","\n","    def ask_for_rank(self):\n","        # If the hand is empty, no rank can be asked\n","        if not self.hand:\n","            return None\n","\n","        # Show player's hand and prompt for a rank\n","        print(f\"{self.name}'s hand: {', '.join(self.hand)}\")\n","        while True:\n","            rank = input(f\"{self.name}, enter the rank you want to ask for: \").strip().upper()\n","            if rank in (card.upper() for card in self.hand):  # Check if the rank is in hand (case-insensitive)\n","                return rank\n","            else:\n","                print(\"Invalid rank.
